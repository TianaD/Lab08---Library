# Lab08 - Library

## Summary

Phil's Lending Library is a console-based application that allows users to manage a collection of books in a library and borrow them into their backpack. The application is built using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and includes classes for Book, Library, and a generic Backpack to hold borrowed items.

## How to Use

1.  Load Books:  When the application starts, it will automatically load some initial books into the library.

2.  View all Books:  This option allows the user to see a list of all the books available in the library. The details of each book, such as title, author, and number of pages, will be displayed.

3.  Add a Book:  Users can add a new book to the library by providing the title, author's first name, last name, and the number of pages.

4.  Borrow a Book:  Users can borrow a book from the library by providing the title of the book they want to borrow. If the book is available, it will be added to their backpack.

5.  Return a Book:  Users can return a book they borrowed by selecting the book from their backpack using its index (or number).

6.  View Book Bag:  This option displays a numbered list of books currently in the user's backpack.

7.  Exit:  This option allows the user to exit the application.
